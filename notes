blue-lacuna
 - help menu is not usable, because there is no way to press enter.
  - JS to capture key onchange of input textfield, and if Return/cursor key etc, send "evtype_CharInput Return\n"
  - see event.c line 131.
 - topics subwindow always reads "Topics: topic, this / more information is often displayed here".

acg
 - Working!

alabaster
 - Attempt to muck about with game's own config file still not working (doesn't like opening file that isn't preexiting?)
 - Graphics
  - window_fill_rect  - extern void glk_window_fill_rect(winid_t win, glui32 color, glsi32 left, glsi32 top, glui32 width, glui32 height);
  - image_get_info    - extern glui32 glk_image_get_info(glui32 image, glui32 *width, glui32 *height);
  - image_draw_scaled - extern glui32 glk_image_draw_scaled(winid_t win, glui32 image, glsi32 val1, glsi32 val2, glui32 width, glui32 height);


advent
 - DONE: help menu, putting a \x0A to a TextGrid doesn't move the cursor
 - help menu: window_set_arrangement and window_get_parent don't work via dispatch.
 - DONE: help menu: gets cleared "for us" after 'n'.

king
 - Graphics?
 - Block vs inline elements for styles -- centred text not working, text background color only set directly behind text.
 - Size info on graphic windows.

curses
 - Gets the windows confused somehow?

emy
 - Done: initial working!
 - Save: needs "???glk_fileref_create_by_prompt usage=1 (SavedGame), filemode=1 (Write)"
 - All writes go to one window?
 - Proper support for glk_style_measure

universal
 - TextBuffer window grows instead of scrolling. - DONE
 - Nicer char input?
 - No way of pressing ret during char input makes most help menus unusable.
 - <title> tags. - DONE
 - expand Game::Window to cover all window attrs
 - add Game::Style ?
 - ajax: return json/content per window, instead of just one - DONE
 - continue, return content without divs/classes etc. - DONE
 - make TextGrid excempt from pages garbage?
 - make get_own_formatted_text part of Game::Window::*?  Likewise ->move_cursor, etc?
 - Chrome: hitting up or down in a charinput box makes the autocomplete thingy show up. - DONE

 - saving
  - type "save", Game responds by running "save_file_name" callback, exits loop, and user is shown save form instead of normal input form (contains "username" and "save game" fields)
 - Re-use input form, by making username universal?
  - add hidden username field / user sessions?

 - output hint about the maximum length of an input line, and verify before sending to game itself
  - truncate or error on "too long"?
